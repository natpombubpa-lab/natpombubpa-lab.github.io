Hi, my name is Kornrachatr Suwattanasilp (Belle), and I’m a fourth-year undergraduate student in the Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University. I’m working on a project called “Investigating Microbial Contamination and Diversity in Swimming Pools.” Basically, I’m studying what kinds of microbes live in swimming pool water and what that means for safety and health. For me, it’s exciting because it shows how biotechnology can be connected to everyday life and help make our environments safer.
