Hi! I'm Ekapol Duangdara, or you just called me Oam. Iâ€™m currently a fourth year student in the faculty of Science of Chulalongkorn University International Program on a majoring of Biotechnology (BBTech). Now I start working my senior project on the topic of Microbial Leather From Fungi on the easiest conditions that suit the atmosphere and the environment of Thailand with my project partner, Bomb, as a member of Aj.Nat Pombubpa laboratory team. The project will be explored of possibilities that we can create an alternative sustainable material for the leather industries in Thailand in the form of Microbial Leather from varieties of selected fungi which we found out that there is still have lots of room to research on since Thailand has a perfect environment on growing the microorganisms without an expensive tools. We hope that our project can be a starter of a big leap of the innovative more sustainable products with an acceptable cost for being choices of leather workers, or craft-mans in the future.
