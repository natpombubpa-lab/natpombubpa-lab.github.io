My name is Chatdanai Rojanatham (Bomb). I'm currently a fourth-year undergraduate student in the Department of Biotechnology (International program), Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University. I'm willing to apply my knowledge and understanding of Biotechnology and Microbiology to the Development of Microbial Leather as an alternative source of materials, contributing to sustainable manufacturing of the future leather industry.
