My name is Natsima Vichienchai (Patty), and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology (International Program) at the Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University. My research focuses on "Unveiling the Bacterial Diversity in Canine Swimming Pools." This project explores microbial ecosystems in environments shared with dogs to enhance understanding of animal health and safety. As a dog lover, I am deeply committed to making meaningful contributions to the field of biotechnology, particularly in ways that promote animal welfare and scientific advancement.
