Hi! My name is Niar Ibrahim (Syahriar Nur Maulana Malik Ibrahim) and currently, I am a Ph.D. student under supervisor Dr. Nuttapon Pombubpa. Previously, I got Bachelor’s degree in Biology at Airlangga University (Indonesia) and a Master’s degree in Biotechnology at Chulalongkorn University. I am interested in microbial (fungi and bacteria) exploration by polyphasic identification (physiology, morphology, ecology, and genetics), their utilization of environment and industry, and their interaction in animals, plants and environments approach by omics.
