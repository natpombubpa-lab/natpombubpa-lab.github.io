Nuttapon (Nat) Pombubpa is currently a lecturer in the Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University. I did my Ph.D. in Professor Jason E. Stajich laboratory at Microbiology and Plant Pathology Department, University of California Riverside. My current research interests include dryland and biological soil crust microbial diversity, desert fungal diversity, and agricultural and envirnometal microbiome research.

I use next generation amplicon sequencing, metagenomic, metabolomics, proteomics, and culturing techniques to explore and answer questions about dryland microbial community.
