My name is Yuki Hayashi. I am a Master student in the Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Engineering, Osaka University.
I have studied here as an exchange student.
In this laboratory, I have conducted research to investigate the effects of beach microbial environment on human health.
I was able to learn and study about sample collection and sample preparation methods.
