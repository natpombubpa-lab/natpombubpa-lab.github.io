My name is Alisara Kaewplung (Fai), and I am a fourth-year student in the Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology International Program (BBTech) at Chulalongkorn University. Currently, I am working on my senior project titled “Unveiling the Hidden Microbiome: Exploring Fungal Diversity in Canine Swimming Pools in Bangkok.”

As a pet lover and owner, I am excited to combine my passion for science and my love for animals to make a meaningful impact, aiming to improve the health and well-being of dogs and their owners.
