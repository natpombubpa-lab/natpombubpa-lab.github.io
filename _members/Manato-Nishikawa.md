My name is Manato Nishikawa, and I am a Masterâ€™s student in the Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Engineering, The University of Osaka. I am participating in this laboratory as a short-term exchange student. In this laboratory, I have conducted research on the effects of microorganisms in rice cultivation soil on rice germination. I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of this laboratory and to learn about microbiology in a supportive environment.
