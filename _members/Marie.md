My name is Marie, I am an exchange student doing a semester at Chulalongkorn University in the Microbiology and Microbial Technology department for the second semester of my master degree. In France I study agriculture engineering at the Superior National School of Agronomy of Toulouse (INP-ENSAT). I am very interested in the interactions between plants and microorganisms. During this exchange, I have the opportunity to have a research project within the laboratory of Dr. Nuttapon Pombubpa, where I study microbial interactions.
