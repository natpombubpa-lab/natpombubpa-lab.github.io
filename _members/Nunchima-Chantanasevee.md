Nunchima Chantanasevee (Lukmai) is a fourth-year undergraduate student in the Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University. I am currently conducting an experiment titled "Unveiling the Hidden Microbiome: Exploring Bacterial Diversity in Canine Swimming Pools."

The study focuses on identifying and understanding the bacterial diversity in canine swimming pools, providing insights into the microbial communities found in this specific environment.
