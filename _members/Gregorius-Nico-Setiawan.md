Hi . . . My name is Gregorius Nico and I am Master student under supervisor of Dr. Nuttapon Pombubpa. I was graduated from Soegijapranata University, Indonesia, with a Bachelor's degree in Food Technology. Currently, I am immersed in the study of metagenomic profiling of soil microbiomes for environmental research aimed at enhancing rice plant growth and productivity.

In the near future, my aspiration is to explore important environmental issues, such as plastic degradation and sustainable agriculture, using the power of omics analysis. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, and I invite you to stay connected through my [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gregorius-Nico-Adi-Setiawan) account.
