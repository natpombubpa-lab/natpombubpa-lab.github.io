I am Pran Panyakong, a fourth-year student majoring in Microbiology at the Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University. I am currently conducting a senior project studying pathogenic fungi, particularly those listed on the WHO Fungal Priority Pathogens List (FPPL), in intertidal areas of Thailand. The study investigates how ocean currents contribute to the dispersal of fungal species and sheds light on the movement of pathogens. This research also identifies fungi of medical importance, which has implications for human health.
