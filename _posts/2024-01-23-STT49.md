Gregorius Nico is part of NatPombubpa Lab, and this is his last semester as a Masterâ€™s student at Chulalongkorn University. He presented part of his thesis research at the 49th International Congress on Science, Technology, and Technology-based Innovation (STT49), 23-25 January 2024, at the Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University, Hatyai Campus, Thailand.

He studied the rhizosphere fungal community in Pathumthani 1 rice under the influence of commercial organic and chemical fertilizers. His primary focus was on the tillering growth stage, an essential stage for the rice plant to grow healthy and productive. The highlight of this study found that chemical fertilizer treatment reduced the amount of saprotroph and symbiotroph fungi, with a lower number of patotroph fungi than the organic fertilizer treatment. Despite the higher amount of patotroph fungi, organic fertilizer treatment increased the number of symbiotroph and saprotroph fungi, which benefits rice's early growth stage. 

Find more about his research at this link: [https://bit.ly/MScProceeding](https://bit.ly/MScProceeding). Recently, he has been preparing a manuscript that includes the bacterial and fungal community in the Pathumthani 1 rice rhizosphere ecosystem, which provides more detailed information about the microbial composition under several fertilizer treatments and fourth rice growth stages.
