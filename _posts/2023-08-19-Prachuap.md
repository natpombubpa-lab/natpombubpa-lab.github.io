## Prachuap Khiri Khan Sampling Trip

On 19 August 2023, our lab did a sampling trip on some of Prachuap Khiri Khan beaches. Our mission is to investigate the microbial diversity in that area, which is expected to have dangerous microbes based on the latitude literature. On this trip, we have two new members of our lab, that are Niar (Ph.D. student) and Yuki (exchange student from Osaka University).

The next day (20 August), we visited some of the tourist areas in Saranwithi Pier and Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park (Wat Khao Daeng).
