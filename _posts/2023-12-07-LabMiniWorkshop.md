The workshop was held on 7 December 2023 to support our lab members in effectively using the HPCC platform for future research. <br>
During this session, we provided basic training on bioinformatics processing, focusing on essential skills for researchers working in this field. The main objective was to ensure that our lab members understand how to navigate the command line and develop simple scripts for data processing. <br>
The workshop was led by Dr. Nuttapon Pombubpa and was attended by three members of our lab along with two external participants.
