5th September is Yuki’s rehearsal in the lab meeting before she presents at Mahidol University about her exchange program results. In the evening, we had a farewell dinner at Chuankin BBQ Mookata. At this dinner, our lab was accompanied by Aj. Choncanok and her lab members did farewell dinner to Yuki’s friend, Sho, who exchanged at Aj. Choncanok lab.
