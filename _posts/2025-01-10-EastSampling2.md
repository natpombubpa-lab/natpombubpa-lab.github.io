On February 10, 2025, our lab conducted the second round of sampling at several beaches in Eastern Thailand. This fieldwork is part of our ongoing mission to investigate microbial diversity in coastal environments. Based on water current patterns and environmental conditions, these areas are suspected to harbor potentially harmful microbes. Through this sampling effort, we aim to better understand the presence, distribution, and potential risks of pathogenic microorganisms in the region, contributing valuable insights for public health and environmental safety.
