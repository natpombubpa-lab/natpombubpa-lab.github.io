On May 24th, our lab held a farewell dinner to celebrate the graduation of our final-year lab members and to bid farewell to Marie Solau, our exchange student from the Superior National School of Agronomy of Toulouse (INP-ENSAT), France, who joined us for the second semester of the 2023 academic year. <br>
<br>
We also celebrated the achievements of our graduating lab members: Gregorius Nico Setiawan (Masterâ€™s student), Monpatcharapan Santichaiyakun (Microbiology undergraduate), Phetcharin Hinmo (Microbiology undergraduate), Chatdanai Rojanatham (BBTech undergraduate), and Ekapol Duangdara (BBTech undergraduate).
