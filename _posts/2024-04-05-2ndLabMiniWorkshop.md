On 5 April 2024, we held a workshop to provide real-time, hands-on training using practical case studies for our lab members. The goal was to ensure participants gained a solid understanding of command-line operations and script development for bioinformatics processing. In this case, we used the metabarcoding raw sequence file then processed it using Amplicon Tool Kit (AMPtk). <br>
The workshop was supervised by Dr. Nuttapon Pombubpa and guided by Niar (the Ph.D. student lab member). It was attended by three of our lab members, the graduate students.
