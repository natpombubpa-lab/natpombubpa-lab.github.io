On October 21, 2024, our lab conducted the first sampling trip along several beaches in Eastern Thailand. This project aims to explore the microbial diversity in these coastal areas, which are suspected to harbor potentially harmful microbes based on water current patterns and local environmental conditions. This sampling effort also serves as the final project for one of our lab members, contributing valuable data to both individual research and the labâ€™s broader objectives.
